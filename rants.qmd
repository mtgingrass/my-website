I deleted my social media. No more doomscrolling, no more endless feeds designed to keep me passive. I donâ€™t need it. I donâ€™t want it. 

Instead, I built this website. No algorithms, no chasing likesâ€”just me, writing what I want, when I want. I know I have no audience. Thatâ€™s fine. This is for me. 

But Iâ€™m not just writing. Iâ€™m moving. Iâ€™m going to the gym. Iâ€™m biking. Iâ€™m hiking. Iâ€™m living. Because I donâ€™t want to just consumeâ€”I want to **do**. 

For too long, I let my time slip away into a black hole of entertainment, news, distractions. But that ends now. 

This isnâ€™t a temporary challenge. This isnâ€™t a phase. This is my life. And Iâ€™m taking control of it. 

So, if youâ€™re reading this, ask yourself: are you consuming, or are you doing?

Elon is neither a data scientist nor a data engineer. Iâ€™m not one either, but I work with data, and the number one rule is that you cannot draw conclusions from data you donâ€™t fully understand.

- What is the definition of each field in the table?

- How was the data collected and processed?

- What does a blank field representâ€”missing data or an intentional omission?

- Are there established rules for interpretation (e.g., assuming individuals over 120 years old are deceased)?

- Is this dataset even the authoritative source of truth for these records?

- What happens if states no longer report deaths, or if reporting errors come from state agencies rather than the federal government?

- Is this data cross-referenced with benefits records?

- What SQL Statement did his young adult entourage use to query this anyway?

A screenshot of this table, without context or analysis, serves only as propaganda, pitting working-class Americans in the private sector against those in the public sector. It distracts from more pressing issues, such as changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the lucrative government contracts Elonâ€™s companies receive, and the broader oligarchic takeover.

No serious data professional would take that screenshot at face value.

Just realized that trying to automate rants was more trouble than it was worth.  
Back to manual updates for a few days.

This is my first rant! Netlify Identity was a pain, but I figured out a better way.
