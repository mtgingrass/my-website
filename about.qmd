## Philosophy & Approach

<div class="row mt-12">
<div class="col-md-6">

### What Drives Me
- **Scalable Architecture**: Building systems that grow with business needs
- **Technology Agnostic**: Choosing the right tool for the job, not the trendy one
- **DevOps Culture**: Continuous integration, delivery, and infrastructure as code
- **Clean Code**: Maintainable, testable, and well-documented solutions
