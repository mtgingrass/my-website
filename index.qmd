## Professional

Technical leader with 20+ years in the federal sector, specializing in enterprise software solutions, Agile transformation, and government contracting.

I love building relationships with stakeholders at all levels. Extensive experience working with defense, regulatory, and federal agencies.

### Current Focus
- **iOS Development**: Building SwiftUI apps with MVVM architecture as a hobbiest
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Leading Agile teams and product strategy
- **Software Contracting & Architecture**: Planning and executing custom software solutions with a focus on system architecture, scalability, and integration

## Outdoor Enthusiast

I've been actively hiking for a few years now. I recently started doing overnighters and love the steep climbs. I also mountain bike and skateboard. I have a partially built-out van and pose as a vanlifer on the weekends from time to time.

My dog, Ollie, is usually along for the ride. He's my trail buddy and road trip companion.
