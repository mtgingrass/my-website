## About Me

Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, outdoor enthusiast, and problem solver.

### Hobbies

Iâ€™ve been actively hiking for a few years now. I recently started doing overnighters and love the steep climbs. I also mountain bike and skateboard. I have a partially built-out van and pose as a vanlifer on the weekends from time to time.

My dog, Ollie, is usually along for the ride. Heâ€™s my trail buddy and road trip companion.

### Curious Mind

I have interests in technology, policy, governance, and efficiency. I enjoy learning about Lean, Six Sigma, and anything related to improving efficiency and eliminating wasteful processes.

At the end of the day, Iâ€™m always seeking ways to combine what I know with what I love.
