## Professional

Product leader with 20+ years in the federal sector. For the past eight years, I have been specializing in product strategy, user-centered innovation, and delivering solutions with tangible outcomes. I have a track record of defining product vision for complex enterprise systems, translating ambiguous stakeholder needs into actionable roadmaps, and leading cross-functional teams to build products that people actually use and value.

I am the connector and translator across disciplines. I work with user needs, business goals, and technical experts daily. I focus on building trust with stakeholders at every level—from end users to division directors and key decision-makers.
Extensive experience partnering with defense, regulatory, and federal agencies to modernize legacy systems and prove that government technology can be world-class.

### Current Focus

* Leading product strategy for FDA modernization initiatives that serve 400+ regulatory scientists
* Building platforms that reduce manual workflows and accelerate decisions
* Championing AI-powered solutions that unlock decades of trapped regulatory data
* Staying technically credible through hands-on iOS development (SwiftUI, because learning keeps me humble)

## Outdoor Enthusiast

I've been actively hiking for a few years now. I recently started doing overnighters and love the steep climbs. I also mountain bike and skateboard. I have a partially built-out van and pose as a vanlifer on the weekends from time to time.

My dog, Ollie, is usually along for the ride. He's my trail buddy and road trip companion.

## Curious Mind

I have interests in technology, policy, governance, and efficiency. I enjoy learning about Lean, Six Sigma, and anything related to improving efficiency and eliminating wasteful processes.

At the end of the day, I'm always seeking ways to combine what I know with what I love.
