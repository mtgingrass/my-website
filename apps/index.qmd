## My Custom IOS Apps

Here you'll find a collection of apps I've developed (or currently developing), each with its own unique features and purpose.

### [Piggy Piggy](/apps/piggy-piggy/)

A financial tracking app designed to help you manage your (kids) savings and track your spending. When Grandpa hands the seven year old kid a 100-dollar bill, you want to hang onto it instead of the child losing it, right? Then download this app to track. 

### [Habit Tracker](/apps/habit-tracker/)

A simple yet powerful habit tracking app built with SwiftUI, helping you build and maintain positive habits. (in progress)

## About My Apps

I try to solve real-world problems that I have with the apps. Simplicty in design is key for me. 

- Clean, intuitive user interfaces
- Privacy-first design
- Solve real-world problems
- Learning Swift, SwiftUI, XCode, and industry best practices

Feel free to try them out and let me know what you think!
