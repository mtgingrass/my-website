A financial tracking app designed to help you manage your savings goals and track your spending habits.

Use Piggy Piggy to:

- Track money given, spent, and saved
- Assign notes to purchases or gifts
- Visualize remaining balances per child or user
- Manage money on-the-go during trips, birthdays, or daily life

Imagine having two children, Kai and Freya, who both received $100 from grandpa. They are too young to track or handle a one-hundred dollar bill, so the parent keeps the money, but tracks their expenses in this simple to use app. 

### Features

- Track daily expenses
- Set and monitor savings goals
- Visual tracking
- Simple design
